# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of both red and white wines using machine learning models, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The models are trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and alcohol content. This repository showcases the implementation, evaluation, and insights derived from these models.
